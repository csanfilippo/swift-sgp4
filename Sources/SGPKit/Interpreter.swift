/// A lightweight interpreter that propagates a TLE using the SGP4 model.
///
/// `TLEInterpreter` bridges to the underlying `SGPKitOBJC` implementation to
/// propagate a Two‑Line Element (TLE) to a specific moment in time and return
/// the result as geodetic latitude/longitude (degrees), altitude (km), and
/// speed (km/h).
///
/// Instances are stateless and inexpensive to create; you can construct and
/// reuse them across multiple calls. Input validation is not performed here—use
/// `TLEParser` to construct a validated `TLE`.
///
/// Thread safety
///  - This type is immutable and `Sendable`. Create and use instances from any
///    concurrency context. Each call constructs its own SGP4 engine internally.
///
/// Performance
///  - This API does not cache results. For repeated evaluations at different
///    times, call the method as needed or implement your own memoization if
///    appropriate for your use case.
///
/// - SeeAlso: `TLE`, `SatelliteData`, `TLEParser`
public final class TLEInterpreter: Sendable {
    
    /// Errors that can occur while interpreting a TLE.
    ///
    /// These errors map from underlying `SGPKitOBJC` failures into a
    /// Swift-friendly representation.
    public enum Error: Swift.Error, Equatable, Sendable {
        /// The provided TLE is invalid or cannot be parsed by the propagation engine.
        case tle
        /// The satellite state could not be computed due to a model or state error.
        case satellite
    }

	/// Computes satellite geodetic position, altitude, and speed for a given date.
	///
	/// Uses the SGP4 propagation model via `SGPKitOBJC` to evaluate the provided
	/// TLE at the specified moment.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - tle: The TLE to propagate. Prefer a value produced by `TLEParser`.
	///   - date: The instant for which to compute the satellite state. `Date` is an
	///           absolute timestamp; results correspond to that exact moment.
	/// - Returns: A `SatelliteData` snapshot with:
	///   - `latitude`/`longitude` in degrees (geodetic, WGS‑84),
	///   - `altitude` in kilometers above the WGS‑84 ellipsoid,
	///   - `speed` in kilometers per hour.
	/// - Throws: ``TLEInterpreter/Error`` when propagation fails.
	///   Specifically, this method throws:
	///   - ``TLEInterpreter/Error/tle`` when the TLE is invalid or unsupported.
	///   - ``TLEInterpreter/Error/satellite`` when the satellite state cannot be computed.
	///
	/// - Discussion: This method constructs a new SGP4 engine on each call and does
	///   not cache results. If you need to evaluate many times in quick succession,
	///   consider reusing the interpreter instance; it is stateless and `Sendable`.
	///
	/// - Example:
	/// ```swift
	/// let interpreter = TLEInterpreter()
	/// let tle = try TLEParser().parse(lines: [line1, line2])
	/// let now = Date()
	/// let state = try interpreter.satelliteData(from: tle, date: now)
	/// print(state.latitude, state.longitude, state.altitude, state.speed)
	/// ```
